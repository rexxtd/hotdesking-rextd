4. Disclamer
    - There are still some bugs/wrong algorithms that have not been fixed yet due to the fact that the developer have to do many other assignments of many other subjects

5. Will this project be updated frequently?
    - Probably only fixing bugs and issue of the algorithms, it is much likely to not have any GUI update
